    \lettersection{About Me}

    I am an electrical and electronics engineer with 12 years of experience in a variety of sectors including clean energy, embedded systems, and robotics. I've been the director of Electrical Engineering and R\&D at my current company since the beginning of 2021 and I'm passionate about hardware and embedded design.

    In addition to my experience in electronics engineering, I have recently been exploring opportunities to shift my career path towards embedded development. I have a passion for clean tech and have contributed to the design of a 99MW wind farm as well as developed a 1.5MW hydrogen fuel cell distributed generation system. My strong experience with motor drives, motion controls, and power electronics has given me a solid foundation in this field. I am also experienced in designing PCBs in Altium Designer and KiCAD, as well as firmware design in embedded C/C++.

    \lettersection{Why Me?}

    % In addition to my experience in a hardware startup,I feel my technical background matches up closely with the requirements for this role in that I have:
    % - A passion for clean tech and have helped design a 99MW wind farm as well as developed a 1.5MW hydrogen fuel cell distributed generation system.
    % - I have strong experience with motor drives, motion controls, and power electronics.
    % - I have experience designing PCBs in Altium Designer and KiCAD.
    % - I'm am experienced in firmware design in embedded C/C++ as well as bare metal driver development on STM32 MUCUs.
    % - I have done many hobby projects that incorporate development boards (arduino, ESP32, ESP8266) and Raspberry PI and posess some minimal UI coding experience: Of note is a home automation server and website I developed on PI and used ESP8266 SoC to enable remote access to my apartment buzzer from an iOS device or web interface.
    What I lack in formal experience as an embedded engineer, I make up for in my dedication to learning and my ability to quickly adapt to new challenges. I have done many hobby projects that incorporate development boards such as the Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, and Raspberry PI. These projects have allowed me to gain experience with bare metal driver development on STM32 MCUs, as well as minimal UI coding experience. Notably, I developed a home automation server and website on a Raspberry PI and used an ESP8266 SoC to enable remote access to my apartment buzzer from an iOS device or web interface.

    I am confident that my technical background, passion for clean tech, and eagerness to learn will make me a valuable asset to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications with you further.
